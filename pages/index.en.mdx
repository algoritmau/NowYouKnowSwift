# Welcome to Learn iOS Dev

**Learn iOS Dev** is an open-source project aimed to help those who would like to start a career as an iOS developer. I started this project by documenting my own learning journey and I hope we can improve it and maintain it with the help of the iOS Development community for future use.

## Why this project?

I started this project as a form of documentation while I was learning iOS development. I took multiple courses and consulted several references online to try to get different perspectives and information on the topics. Later, I decided to expand the project and make it as a sort of guide to help newcomers to dive into iOS development.

## What can I learn with this project?

**Learn iOS Dev** includes lessons on the [fundamentals of Swift](/swift-fundamentals/basics) —the programming language to develop for Apple operating systems—, [advanced Swift](/advanced-swift/intro), [UI Kit](/ui-kit/intro), [SwiftUI](/swiftui/intro), and App Design.
